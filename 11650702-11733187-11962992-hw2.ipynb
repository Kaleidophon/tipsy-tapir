    "In this assignment you will get familiar with basic and advanced information retrieval concepts. You will implement different information retrieval ranking models and evaluate their performance.\n",

    "We provide you with a Indri index. To query the index, you'll use a Python package ([pyndri](https://github.com/cvangysel/pyndri)) that allows easy access to the underlying document statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluation you'll use the [TREC Eval](https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval) utility, provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States. TREC Eval is the de facto standard way to compute Information Retrieval measures and is frequently referenced in scientific papers.\n",

    "This is a **groups-of-three assignment**, the deadline is **Wednesday, January 31st**. Code quality, informative comments and convincing analysis of the results will be considered when grading.

    "The TREC Eval utility can be downloaded and compiled as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval.git\n",

    "TREC Eval computes evaluation scores given two files: ground-truth information regarding relevant documents, named *query relevance* or *qrel*, and a ranking of documents for a set of queries, referred to as a *run*. The *qrel* will be supplied by us and should not be changed. For every retrieval model (or combinations thereof) you will generate a run of the top-1000 documents for every query. The format of the *run* file is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $query_identifier Q0 $document_identifier $rank_of_document_for_query $query_document_similarity $run_identifier\n",
    "    \n",
    "where\n",
    "   * `$query_identifier` is the unique identifier corresponding to a query (usually this follows a sequential numbering).\n",
    "   * `Q0` is a legacy field that you can ignore.\n",
    "   * `$document_identifier` corresponds to the unique identifier of a document (e.g., APXXXXXXX where AP denotes the collection and the Xs correspond to a unique numerical identifier).\n",
    "   * `$rank_of_document_for_query` denotes the rank of the document for the particular query. This field is ignored by TREC Eval and is only maintained for legacy support. The ranks are computed by TREC Eval itself using the `$query_document_similarity` field (see next). However, it remains good practice to correctly compute this field.\n",
    "   * `$query_document_similarity` is a score indicating the similarity between query and document where a higher score denotes greater similarity.\n",
    "   * `$run_identifier` is an identifier of the run. This field is for your own convenience and has no purpose beyond bookkeeping.\n",
    "   \n",
    "For example, say we have two queries: `Q1` and `Q2` and we rank three documents (`DOC1`, `DOC2`, `DOC3`). For query `Q1`, we find the following similarity scores `score(Q1, DOC1) = 1.0`, `score(Q1, DOC2) = 0.5`, `score(Q1, DOC3) = 0.75`; and for `Q2`: `score(Q2, DOC1) = -0.1`, `score(Q2, DOC2) = 1.25`, `score(Q1, DOC3) = 0.0`. We can generate run using the following snippet:"

An example on how to integrate Pyndri with Gensim for word2vec can be found [here](https://github.com/cvangysel/pyndri/blob/master/examples/word2vec.py). For the remaining latent vector space models, you will need to implement connector classes (such as `IndriSentences`) by yourself.\n",

    "   * calculate the similarity between **q** and **d** (e.g., cosine similarity, KL-divergence).\n",

    "Each of these LSMs come with various hyperparameters to tune. Make a choice on the parameters, and explicitly mention the reasons that led you to these decisions. You can use the validation set to optimize hyper parameters you see fit; motivate your decisions. In addition, mention clearly how the query/document representations were constructed for each LSM and explain your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, you will first obtain an initial top-1000 ranking for each query using TF-IDF in **Task 1**, and then re-rank the documents using the LSMs. Use TREC Eval to obtain the results and report on `NDCG@10`, Mean Average Precision (`MAP@1000`), `Precision@5` and `Recall@1000`.\n",
